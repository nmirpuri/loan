# Loan_Prediction_Web_Application
The Loan Prediction Web Application is a web-based tool that predicts loan approval based on user input. It utilizes a machine learning model to provide an estimated outcome for loan applications. This project aims to assist individuals and financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals.

# Features
* User-friendly Interface: The web application offers a simple and intuitive user interface where users can easily input their information.

* Prediction: Once the user submits their details, the application processes the input and provides a prediction regarding loan approval.

* Model Integration: The application integrates a pre-trained machine learning model that has been trained on historical loan data.

* Customizability: The project provides flexibility for users to customize and improve the prediction model according to their specific requirements.

* Scalability: The web application is built using the Express.js framework, ensuring scalability to handle a large number of concurrent users.

# Technologies Used
* Node.js: The server-side runtime environment that powers the web application.
* Express.js: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js that handles routing and middleware.
* EJS: A templating engine that enables dynamic content rendering on the server.
