# Loan_Prediction_Web_Application
The Loan Prediction Web Application is a web-based tool that predicts loan approval based on user input. It utilizes a machine learning model to provide an estimated outcome for loan applications. This project aims to assist individuals and financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals.

# Features
* User-friendly Interface: The web application offers a simple and intuitive user interface where users can easily input their information.

* Prediction: Once the user submits their details, the application processes the input and provides a prediction regarding loan approval.

* Model Integration: The application integrates a pre-trained machine learning model that has been trained on historical loan data.

* Customizability: The project provides flexibility for users to customize and improve the prediction model according to their specific requirements.

* Scalability: The web application is built using the Express.js framework, ensuring scalability to handle a large number of concurrent users.

# Technologies Used
* Node.js: The server-side runtime environment that powers the web application.
* Express.js: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js that handles routing and middleware.
* EJS: A templating engine that enables dynamic content rendering on the server.
* Python: The programming language used for machine learning model training and prediction.
* Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library in Python for handling structured data.
* scikit-learn: A popular machine learning library in Python that provides various algorithms and tools for model training and evaluation.
* Joblib: A Python library used for serializing and deserializing machine learning models.
* Git: Version control system for managing project codebase.

# Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:
* Node.js
* Python
* pip 
* npm

# Installation
1.Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository_url>
```
2.Install the required Node.js dependencies:
```
cd loan-prediction-web-app
npm init
npm install
```
# Usage
* Start the Node.js server:
```
node server.js
```
* Access the web application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
* Fill out the loan prediction form with the required information.
* Click the "Submit" button.
* The application will process the input and display the prediction result.

# Customization
If you want to customize or improve the model, follow these steps:

* Modify the loan_prediction.py file to update the prediction logic.
* Train a new model using your preferred machine learning algorithm.
* Save the trained model as model.joblib in the project directory.
* Update the loan_prediction.py file in the Express.js server code to reflect any changes made to the model.
* Restart the server to apply the changes.
